== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =
Analytics Spam Blocker adds a list of domains to be blocked to your .htaccess file. This list is regularly updated next to what you add yourself so you'll be able to filter out the majority of referrer spam very quickly.

= How does the list get updated? =
Matomo Analytics publishes a list of domains to be blocked. Analytics Spam Blocker downloads this list weekly and adds it to your blocklist.

= Who manages the blocklist updates? =
In a way, you do. But the majority of domains are community managed and published by Matomo Analytics through Github.
